Project description: My final project will be an enhanced version of the classic Mario. There will be obstacles (like spikes, spiked balls, and killer birds), powerups (double jump, and invincibility), and traps (pitfalls and poison areas that slow movement). The game will have a scoring system based on time and intensity of the situation. There will be 3 designed levels and an infinite mode where the game difficulty lowers but the game goes on forever.
